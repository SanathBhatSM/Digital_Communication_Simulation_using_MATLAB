# Digital_Communication_Simulation_using_MATLAB
This repository consists of simulation experiments of communication laboratory of VTU cirriculum with subject code 18ECL67 using matlab. It also consists of output graphs each experiment

## Experiment 1: Line Codes
- Simulate NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero)
- Simulate RZ (Return-to-Zero)
- Simulate Half-Sinusoid Pulse
- Simulate Raised Cosine Pulse
- Generate Eye Diagram for Binary Polar Signaling

## Experiment 2: Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
- Implement Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) System
- Implement PCM Demodulation

## Experiment 3: Probability of Bit Error
- Compute the Probability of Bit Error
- For Coherent Binary ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying)
- For Coherent Binary FSK (Frequency Shift Keying)
- For Coherent Binary PSK (Phase Shift Keying)
- Under AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) Channel
- Compare with Performance Curves

## Experiment 4: Digital Modulation Schemes
- Implement DPSK (Differential Phase Shift Keying) Transmitter and Receiver
- Implement QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) Transmitter and Receiver
